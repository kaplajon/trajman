Trajman: Trajectory Manager

Author: Jon Kapla, jon.kapla@mmk.su.se

Trajman is a linux based molecular dynamics trajectory analysis
tool written in fortran. It is mainly aimed towards analysis of
simulations of model lipid membranes, but can easily be adopted
for other use as well.

Installation:

Trajman needs the Visual Molecular Dynamics molfile plugin to
be functional. Get the source code, and compile the plugins.

Make sure you also compile the fortran c wrapper located in 
the molfile_plugin/f77 folder.

When you have VMD plugins compiled. Compile trajman by telling
make where your VMD plugins are situated, and what archflag you
used. Note that you need gfortran. Here's a 64-bit example:

make VMD_ARCH=LINUXAMD64 VMD_PLUGINS=/home/jon/src/vmd/plugins

Run trajman -h for more information about usage.
