TRAJMAN: A MD TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS TOOL

Trajman is a linux based molecular dynamics trajectory analysis
tool written in fortran. It is mainly aimed towards analysis of
simulations of model lipid membranes, but can easily be adopted
for other use as well.

Get Trajman source code:

Trajman source code can be downloaded with bazaar. Get a recent
version of bazaar from http://bazaar.canocical.com and issue the 
following command:

> bzr branch http://people.su.se/~jkapl/trajman trajman

Since the program is in constant development it might be wise
to check the commit log for suitable revisions and changes.

> bzr log

Dependencies:

Trajman needs the Visual Molecular Dynamics molfile plugin to
be functional. Get the source code, and compile the plugins.

http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/

Make sure you also compile the fortran c wrapper located in 
the molfile_plugin/f77 folder.

Build:

When you have VMD plugins compiled. Compile trajman by telling
make where your VMD plugins are situated, and what archflag you
used. Note that you need gfortran. Here's a 64-bit example:

make VMD_ARCH=LINUXAMD64 VMD_PLUGINS=/home/jon/src/vmd/plugins

Run trajman -h for more information about usage.
