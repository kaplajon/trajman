{"name":"Trajman","tagline":"Trajman is a linux based molecular dynamics trajectory analysis tool written in fortran. It is mainly aimed towards analysis of simulations of model lipid membranes, but can easily be adopted for other use as well.","body":"Since the project is of personal character, the functionality and/or documentation of the program can not be guaranteed to be correct. Use the program with caution, and always check the relevance of the results. \r\n\r\nSince the documentation of the program is not yet complete, browsing the module_trajop.f90 file is the best way to get a feeling for the program functionality. The trajman_documentation.txt file, however, gives an overview of the original and basic functionality of Trajman.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n**Copyright (C) 2010-2014, Jon Kapla, kaplajon@gmail.com**\r\n\r\n Trajman is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n Trajman is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

There is a version of the molfile_plugin \r\nin the trajman build dir. You have also the possibility to \r\ndownload and build the latest version from:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/\r\n\r\nMake sure you also compile the fortran c wrapper located in \r\nthe molfile_plugin/f77 folder.\r\n\r\nFor dependencies of the vmd plugins, please see the vmd homepage.\r\n\r\nYou need gfortran to build the trajman binary.\r\n\r\n## Build example:\r\n\r\nCompile vmd plugins (Please read the license file in the\r\nvmd_plugins1.9 dir):\r\n\r\n>\\> cd vmd_plugins1.9\r\n>\r\n>\\> make LINUXAMD64 TCLINC=-I/usr/include/tcl8.5 TCLLIB=-F/usr/lib\r\n>\r\n>\\> cd molfile_plugin/f77\r\n>\r\n>\\> make ARCH=LINUXAMD64 FC=gfortran TCLLIB=-L/usr/lib NETCDFLIB=-L/usr/lib TCLLDFLAGS=-ltcl8.5 f77_molfile.o\r\n\r\nWhen you have VMD plugins compiled. Compile trajman by telling\r\nmake where your VMD plugins are situated, and what archflag you\r\nused. Note that you need gfortran. Here's a 64-bit example:\r\n\r\n>\\> make VMD_ARCH=LINUXAMD64 VMD_PLUGINS=vmd_plugins1.9/\r\n\r\n(or set the environment variables in the Makefile directly and use 'make')\r\n\r\nFor more information about usage, run:\r\n\r\n>\\> ./trajman -h","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
