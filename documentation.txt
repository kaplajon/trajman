[INPUTFILE]

Syntax is one function or setting per line. Blank lines and comments (#) are ignored.

SETTINGS
----------------------------------
set
	traj FILE			   :: Set the trajectory file. This setting must be the first non commented line

	maxframes N			   :: N number of frames to be processed. N=0 means all frames. Default "0".

	atomnames FILE			   :: Custom unique atomnames for the trajectory. Names must be in the same order as in the trajectory file.

	atommasses [FILE]		   :: Set default atommasses. If FILE is specified, atommasses are set according to that instead of the
					      default values.

	autofilename on,off		   :: Set automatic filename creation for output files on or off. Default "on".

	filename FILE			   :: Set the filename explicitly to FILE (char). This setting will override autofilename.

	fileprefix [prefix_]		   :: Custom prefix for autofilenames (char, can be a system path). Default "auto_".

	filesuffix [.suffix]		   :: Custom suffix for autofilenames (char). Default ".out".

	distbin N			   :: Set number of bins, N (int), used for distributions. Default "100".

	centerofmembrane molecule1 ...	   :: Calculate center of membrane based on named molecules separated by space (char)

	cbl R				   :: Set constant bondlength, R (real), with same unit as the trajectory.

	writeframe N			   :: Write frame N (int) to a file with name frameN.xyz in xyz format (plottable by e.g. gOpenmol).

	calc [distrib,traj,acorr]	   :: Defines postprocessing of the calculated FUNCTIONS (see below).

						   distrib writes distributions
						   traj writes trajectories
						   acorr writes autocorrelations (WARNING! This can take a very long time!)

FUNCTIONS
----------------------------------

DA Atom1 Atom2			:: Director angle: Angle between the vector Atom1-Atom2 against the director

VA Atom1 Atom2 Atom3		:: Valence angle. First atom is the central atom.

TA Atom1 Atom2 Atom3 Atom4	:: Torsion angle of atoms 1-4

BL Atom1 Atom2			:: Bond length (or distance) between two atoms

SV Atom1 Atom2			:: Order parameter

MP Atom1			:: Distance of atom1 from the centerofmembrane

corr	 			:: Correlate the two following functions in a correlation distribution.

DC Atom1 Atom2			:: Dipolecoupling of Atom1 and Atom2 (typically a C-H vector)

average N			:: Calculate an average of the following N (int) functions (e.g. averaging a CH3 group)


[FILES]

atoms.xyz			 :: This file contains atomnames and coordinates for each molecular type defined in the trajectory.

[fileprefix]averages[filesuffix] :: FUNCTION averages and statistical data of the format:
				    <index> <function definition> = <compact average> <average> <mean std> <std> [<dist. entropy> <mutual dist.entropy>]
