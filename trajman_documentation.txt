INPUTFILE: SYNTAX

Syntax is one function or setting per line. Blank lines and comments (#) are ignored.


INPUTFILE: SETTINGS
Usage: set setfunction options
----------------------------------
set

	init FILE

The file for trajectory initialization. Must be at least
one frame and in .gro format. This setting must be the first
noncommented line in the input file.

	traj FILE

Set the trajectory file. This setting must
be the second non commented line. Only files in the
.gro and .trr format are supported at the moment.
Trr-trajectories are recommended for speed.

	maxframes N

N number of frames to be processed. N=0 means that the
trajectory will be examined to get the number of frames
automatically. WARNING! For trr-files N=0 means that trajman
cycles through the whole trajectory file, which can take a
long time depending on the trajectory length.
Default "0".

	atomnames FILE

Custom unique atomnames for the trajectory. 
Names must be in the same order as in the trajectory file.

	atommasses [FILE]

Set default atommasses.
If FILE is specified, atommasses are set according
to that instead of the default values.

	whole

By setting this, molecules that have been broken due to
periodic boundary conditions, will be made whole again by 
back folding of atom coordinates.

	folding

If the center of mass of a molecule lies outside the box,
it will be folded back in by this setting.


	autofilename on,off

Set automatic filename creation for output files on or off.
Default "on".

	filename [FILENAME,off]

Set the filename explicitly to FILENAME (char). This setting 
will override autofilename. If filename and autofilename
are both set to off, output will be directed to STDOUT.
If used with autofilename set to 'on' the set filename will
be automatically suffixed with type of postcalculation.
See also fileprefix and filesuffix below.

	fileprefix [prefix_]
    
Custom prefix for filenames (char, can be a system path).
Default "auto_".

	filesuffix [.suffix]

Custom suffix for filenames (char). Default ".out".

    	distbin N

Set number of bins, N (int), used for distributions.
Default "100".

    	cbl R

Set constant bondlength, R (real),
with same unit as the trajectory.

    	writeframe N [xyz,gro,apl]

Write frame N (int) to a file with name frameN.xyz in xyz format (default,
plottable by e.g. gOpenmol). If gro is added to the end of the
command, the output will be in .gro-format. If apl is used as format and
apl is set, area per lipid grid information is written (Voronoi like data).

    	calc [distrib,traj,acorr ... ]

Defines postprocessing of the calculated FUNCTIONS (see below).
distrib: writes distributions
distribm: writes distributions per molecule
traj: writes trajectories
trajm: writes trajectories per molecule
acorr: writes autocorrelations
acorrm writes autocorrelations per molecule

    	submoltype NAME startatom endatom

Define a submolecule of an existing molecule, defined 
by the atoms between startatom and endatom.

	apl atom1 [atom2 ...]

Define the atoms used to calculate the area per lipid in a membrane.
The atoms may come from the same or different molecule types
(or from atoms defined in a submoltype).

	aplgrid x y

Define the grid size used in area per lipid calcualtions.

	leaflets

Define membrane leaflets to be able to separate calculations
based on which side of the membrane a molecule is situated.
Needs centerofmembrane and atommasses.
With arguments:

INPUTFILE: DEFINITIONS
Usage: define options
----------------------------------
define
	atom NAME SUBMOLPROP SUBMOL

Define a new atom with name, NAME, from a property (SUBMOLPROP)
of a defined submolecule (SUBMOL). SUBMOLPROP can for now only
be set to 'com', which is the center of mass of the submolecule.

    	centerofmembrane molecule1 ...

Calculate center of membrane based on named molecules
separated by space (char)

	leaflet [both,upper,lower]

upper,lower: Following calculations will only be performed on 
	     the specified side of the bilayer.
       both: Default. Calculations are performed without leaflet separation.
Definition of leaflets is mandatory if you're doing area per lipid calculations.


INPUTFILE: FUNCTIONS
Usage: function options [tag]
----------------------------------
All functions can be tagged by a string at
the end of the line. The tags are used by
i.e. corr.

	DA Atom1 Atom2

Director angle: Angle between the vector Atom1-Atom2
against the director

	VA Atom1 Atom2 Atom3

Valence angle. First atom is the central atom.

	TA Atom1 Atom2 Atom3 Atom4
	
Torsion angle of atoms 1-4

	BL Atom1 Atom2

Bond length (or distance) between two atoms

	SV Atom1 Atom2

Order parameter

	MP Atom1

Distance of atom1 from the centerofmembrane

	corr tag1 tag2
	
Correlate two functions previously tagged by tag1 (str) and
tag2 (str)(corr needs to come after the two functions in the
input file). To get output other than a pearson coefficient
calc has to be set to distrib and/or distribm.

	DC Atom1 Atom2
	
Dipolecoupling of Atom1 and Atom2 (typically a C-H vector)

	average N
	
Calculate an average of the following N (int) functions
(e.g. averaging a CH3 group)

	combine N

Combine the data per molecule from N (int) functions into
one.

	AL atom1 [atom2 ...]

Calculate area per lipid for defined atoms.
If more than one atom is given, all additional atoms need to
belong to the same molecule type as the first.


TRAJMAN DEFAULT FILES:

	atoms.xyz

This file contains atomnames and coordinates for each molecular type
defined in the trajectory.

	[fileprefix]averages[filesuffix]

FUNCTION averages and statistical data of the format:
 <index> <function definition> = <compact average> <average> <mean std> <std> [<dist. entropy> <mutual dist.entropy>]
