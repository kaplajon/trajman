INPUTFILE: SYNTAX

Syntax is one function or setting per line. Blank lines and comments (#) are ignored.

INPUTFILE: SETTINGS
----------------------------------
set
    traj FILE			:: Set the trajectory file. This setting must
				   be the first non commented line.

    maxframes N			:: N number of frames to be processed. N=0 means
				   all frames. Default "0".

    atomnames FILE		:: Custom unique atomnames for the trajectory. 
				   Names must be in the same order as in the trajectory file.

    atommasses [FILE]		:: Set default atommasses. If FILE is specified, atommasses
				   are set according to that instead of the default values.

    autofilename on,off		:: Set automatic filename creation for output files on or off.
				   Default "on".

    filename [FILENAME,off]	:: Set the filename explicitly to FILENAME (char). This setting 
   				   will override autofilename. If filename and autofilename
				   are both set to off, output will be directed to STDOUT.
				   If used with autofilename set to 'on' the set filename will
				   be automatically suffixed with type of postcalculation.
				   See also fileprefix and filesuffix below.

    fileprefix [prefix_]	:: Custom prefix for filenames (char, can be a system path).
				   Default "auto_".

    filesuffix [.suffix]	:: Custom suffix for filenames (char). Default ".out".

    distbin N			:: Set number of bins, N (int), used for distributions.
				   Default "100".

    centerofmembrane molecule1 ... :: Calculate center of membrane based on named molecules
				   separated by space (char)

    cbl R			:: Set constant bondlength, R (real), with same unit as the trajectory.

    writeframe N		:: Write frame N (int) to a file with name frameN.xyz in xyz format
				   (plottable by e.g. gOpenmol).

    calc [distrib,traj,acorr]	:: Defines postprocessing of the calculated FUNCTIONS (see below).
				    distrib writes distributions
				    traj writes trajectories
				    acorr writes autocorrelations 
				    (WARNING! Autocorrelation can take a very long time!)

    submolecule NAME startatom endatom :: Define a submolecule of an existing molecule, defined 
					  by the atoms between startatom and endatom.

INPUTFILE: FUNCTIONS
----------------------------------
define atom NAME SUBMOLPROP SUBMOL :: Define a new atom with name, NAME, from a property (SUBMOLPROP)
				      of a defined submolecule (SUBMOL). SUBMOLPROP can for now only
				      be set to 'com', which is the center of mass of the submolecule.

DA Atom1 Atom2		           :: Director angle: Angle between the vector Atom1-Atom2
			              against the director

VA Atom1 Atom2 Atom3	           :: Valence angle. First atom is the central atom.

TA Atom1 Atom2 Atom3 Atom4         :: Torsion angle of atoms 1-4

BL Atom1 Atom2		           :: Bond length (or distance) between two atoms

SV Atom1 Atom2	    	           :: Order parameter

MP Atom1		           :: Distance of atom1 from the centerofmembrane

corr	 		           :: Correlate the two following functions in a correlation
			              distribution.

DC Atom1 Atom2		           :: Dipolecoupling of Atom1 and Atom2 (typically a C-H vector)

average N		           :: Calculate an average of the following N (int) functions
			              (e.g. averaging a CH3 group)


TRAJMAN DEFAULT FILES:

atoms.xyz			 :: This file contains atomnames and coordinates for each molecular type
				    defined in the trajectory.

[fileprefix]averages[filesuffix] :: FUNCTION averages and statistical data of the format:
 <index> <function definition> = <compact average> <average> <mean std> <std> [<dist. entropy> <mutual dist.entropy>]
